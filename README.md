## CV - Juliana Nocchi

I am a career-changer software engineer who enjoys working on projects from start to finish. During my 16-week bootcamp I worked with front end languages and frameworks such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and React Native to create stunning user interfaces; back end technologies and frameworks, including NodeJS and ExpressJS; database management systems, such as PostgreSQL and MongoDB; and version control to collaborate effectively with other developers on large-scale projects.

I value continuous learning (currently working my way through C# and Phyton) and I am passionate about building strong relationships. I believe that collaboration, communication, and respect are essential for any successful project. For highlights of my professional skills from peers and managers, please have a look at my [LinkedIn Recommendations](https://www.linkedin.com/in/juliana-nocchi-b4a882222/details/recommendations/?detailScreenTabIndex=0).

## üß∏ Soft Skills

### **Problem Solving**

I love to be part of new initiatives and solve challenges. Starting with mapping, considering all alternatives, and identifying which option to pursue, through to sharing my findings, decisions and solutions with others (e.g. visa requests and appraisal cycles).

### **Collaboration & Building relationships**

In my previous roles, I have adopted a networked approach, collaborating with other teams to achieve joint goals (e.g. with HR and Procurement, to deliver the European Health & Safety plan). I have also developed and maintained strong relationships with key stakeholders (e.g. office suppliers, benefit providers). 

### **Positivity**
I like being a go-to person and creating an inclusive and positive environment. This was highlighted by my ex-colleagues via my [LinkedIn recommendations](https://www.linkedin.com/in/juliana-nocchi-b4a882222/details/recommendations/?detailScreenTabIndex=0).

### **Organisational skills**

I am used to simultaneously planning and prioritising projects across multiple areas (e.g. finance, IT, hiring, procurement, HR core, facilities). I also have experience of organising and structuring team resources and processes (e.g. network drive, employee files).
