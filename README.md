## üß∏ Soft Skills
### **Problem Solving**
As someone who enjoys taking on new challenges and being part of new initiatives, I am proud to say that my latest adventure was to take part in a 24-hour hackathon. We formed the group on the day of the event, came up with an idea and started breaking our MVP down into smaller, more manageable parts so that everyone was aware of what they should do. We had a great time, and our project won two prizes. On another occasion, I realised our website's home page needed a 'Mobile first' approach, so I paired with a colleague to discuss our options and implement the changes. I learned about the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI), and since then, I have become an advocate for it, creating awareness and sharing WAI resources with the teams I work with.

### **Collaboration & Building relationships**
In my previous roles, I have adopted a networked approach, collaborating with other teams to achieve joint goals (e.g. with Procurement to negotiate better prices) and maintaining strong relationships with key stakeholders (e.g. office suppliers and benefit providers). During my Software Engineering training, I have adapted to different team dynamics, supported those who were struggling so they would not fall behind (e.g.project setup), and learned CSS on the go to help the team complete the project successfully when we found ourselves in a group without previous experience in this language. After the end of the course, my peer group and I decided to continue meeting and working together on projects, so we developed [Pensano Devs](https://pensano.dev/) which now has 10+ volunteer developers and designers working on meaningful projects while building their tech portfolios. I like being a go-to person and fostering an inclusive and positive environment. This was highlighted by my ex-colleagues via my [LinkedIn recommendations](https://www.linkedin.com/in/juliana-nocchi-b4a882222/details/recommendations/?detailScreenTabIndex=0).

### **Organisational skills**
As EMEA Growth Chief of Staff, I have become adept at multitasking and prioritising projects across various countries and areas, including Finance, IT, Hiring, Procurement, HR, and Facilities. My experience includes organising and streamlining team resources and processes, such as maintaining a network drive and employee files. As a member of a tech team, I like using project management tools and team charters to establish priorities, set deadlines, and ensure that everyone on the team is on the same page and has a clear understanding of their responsibilities. I like to work with prototypes and have been learning Figma in my free time. This ensures consistency across different sections of the web/mobile app and offers guidance regarding colour schemes, font sizes, and position of elements.
