## Juliana Nocchi
I started my professional life editing audio & videos for an e-Learning company and teaching visual arts (including stop-motion animation). In 2013 I moved to London and for 7 years I worked in roles ranging from HR to People Ops.

In my last position, I worked for a Tech company and during my time there I took part in many Digital Commerce and Platform training. That made me curious about the coding behind it and I started to think about improving my technical skills. In August 2022, my role ceased to exist and I was made redundant, so I saw it as an opportunity to invest some time into learning code. 

I joined Codebar and it lead me to Makers Academy. I am half way through the bootcamp and I cannot express how much I am enjoying it! I love meeting my peer group every morning and learning new things every day. To progress in our weekly challenges, we have a few hours of solo study in the mornings and we pair up in the afternoons. We are in contact with the Makers alumni, we have daily meditation sessions and valuable Emotional intelligence workshops with Dana, the Chief Joy Officer. We take part in weekly retro meetings, and we have the support of our coach and colleagues. Makers encourage the real Dev culture from day one and I am very grateful to be part of this community.

I am very excited about starting a career as a Junior Software Developer!

## Skills

### **Problem Solving**

I love to be part of new initiatives and solve challenges. Starting with mapping, considering all alternatives, and identifying which option to pursue, through to sharing my findings, decisions and solutions with others (e.g. visa requests and appraisal cycles).

#### **Collaboration & Building relationships**

In my previous roles, I have adopted a networked approach, collaborating with other teams to achieve joint goals (e.g. with HR and Procurement, to deliver the European Health & Safety plan). I have also developed and maintained strong relationships with key stakeholders (e.g. office suppliers, benefit providers). 

### **Positivity**
I like being a go-to person and creating an inclusive and positive environment. This was highlighted by my ex-colleagues via my [LinkedIn recommendations](https://www.linkedin.com/in/juliana-nocchi-b4a882222/details/recommendations/?detailScreenTabIndex=0).

#### **Organisational skills**

I am used to simultaneously planning and prioritising projects across multiple areas (e.g. finance, IT, hiring, procurement, HR core, facilities). I also have experience of organising and structuring team resources and processes (e.g. network drive, employee files).
