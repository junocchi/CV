## Juliana Nocchi

During my time working for a Tech company, I had the opportunity to take part in various training sessions, including Digital Commerce and Ecommerce Architecture. After that, I could understand more about how our lives, and in this case, how our shopping experience has been transformed by technology. I enjoyed the culture, the collaborative approach, and the fast-paced environment, and all of that inspired me to improve my technical skills, so I joined Codebar and started learning code. 

A few months later I decided to make a career switch to tech and I chose Makers Academy because of its cutting-edge curriculum and inclusive community support. I enjoy pair programming and solving difficult challenges, and I am looking forward to starting a career as a Junior Software Developer.

## Skills

### **Problem Solving**

I love to be part of new initiatives and solve difficult challenges. Starting with mapping, considering all alternatives, and identifying which option to pursue, through to sharing my findings, decisions and solutions with others (e.g. visa requests and appraisal cycles).

#### **Collaboration & Building relationships**

In my previous roles, I have adopted a networked approach, collaborating with other teams to achieve joint goals (e.g. with HR and Procurement, to deliver a European Health & Safety plan). I have also developed and maintained strong relationships with key stakeholders (e.g. office suppliers, benefit providers). 

### **Positivity**
I like being a go-to person and creating an inclusive and positive environment. This was highlighted by my ex-colleagues via my [LinkedIn recommendations](https://www.linkedin.com/in/juliana-nocchi-b4a882222/details/recommendations/?detailScreenTabIndex=0).

#### **Organisational skills**

I am used to simultaneously planning and prioritising projects across multiple areas (e.g. finance, IT, hiring, procurement, HR core, facilities). I also have experience of organising and structuring team resources and processes (e.g. network drive, employee files).
