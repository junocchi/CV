## üß∏ Soft Skills
### **Problem Solving**
As someone who enjoys taking on new challenges and being part of new initiatives, I have spent years studying immigration law, brainstorming potential solutions, and collaborating with colleagues to achieve a 100% visa approval rate. As a developer, I break complex problems down into manageable parts using TDD and using analogies to make abstract concepts more accessible. I also enjoy pairing with colleagues to solve codewars, and learn new techniques and methodologies. For example, when we realized our website's home page needed a 'Mobile first' approach, I paired with a colleague to create a plan and break down the tasks into smaller pieces. After implementing the changes, we explained the concept to the team and followed this product design principle when starting a new page, resulting in a faster website, more accessible, and easier to navigate.


### **Collaboration & Building relationships**
In my previous roles, I have adopted a networked approach, collaborating with other teams to achieve joint goals (e.g. with Procurement to negotiate better prices) and maintaining strong relationships with key stakeholders (e.g. office suppliers and benefit providers). During my Software Engineering training, I have adapted to different team dynamics, supported those who were struggling so they would not fall behind (e.g.project setup), and learned CSS on the go to help the team complete the project successfully when we found ourselves in a group without previous experience in this language. After the end of the course, my peer group and I decided to continue meeting and working together on projects, so we developed [Pensano Devs](https://pensano.dev/).
I like being a go-to person and creating an inclusive and positive environment. This was highlighted by my ex-colleagues via my [LinkedIn recommendations](https://www.linkedin.com/in/juliana-nocchi-b4a882222/details/recommendations/?detailScreenTabIndex=0).

### **Organisational skills**
As Chief of Staff, I have become adept at multitasking and prioritizing projects across various areas, including Finance, IT, Hiring, Procurement, HR, and Facilities. My experience includes organising and streamlining team resources and processes, such as maintaining a network drive and employee files. As a member of a tech team, I like using project management software and team charters to establish priorities, set deadlines, and ensure that everyone on the team is on the same page and has a clear understanding of their responsibilities. Also, during a website project, I provided my colleagues with a prototype of all pages, complete with colour schemes, font sizes and position of elements, to ensure consistency across different sections of the site.
